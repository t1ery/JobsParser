#HeadHunter Job Scraper

This is a Python script that scrapes job listings from HeadHunter for a given keyword.
Usage

    Clone the repository or download the hh_job_scraper.py file.
    Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the script with python hh_job_scraper.py and provide a keyword as an argument, e.g. python hh_job_scraper.py Python.

The script will output a list of job listings containing the job title, company, location, and link to the listing.
Notes

    The script uses the requests and beautifulsoup4 packages to scrape the HeadHunter website. It has been tested on the Replit platform and may not work consistently on other platforms or in other environments.
    The ITEMS variable can be changed to specify the number of job listings to retrieve per page (default is 100).
    If the script encounters errors or is blocked by HeadHunter, you may need to modify the headers variable to include additional information or use a different user agent.
